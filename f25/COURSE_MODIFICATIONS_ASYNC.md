# CSCI 347 Modifications for Undergraduate Asynchronous Delivery

**Date**: August 2025  
**Issue**: Current course designed for graduate-level cybersecurity program with extensive lab support  
**Context**: 3 undergraduate students, networking/Python background, asynchronous standalone delivery  
**Key Requirement**: Preserve strong forensics emphasis while making content undergraduate-appropriate

## Executive Summary

This document outlines essential modifications to make CSCI 347 appropriate for **undergraduate** asynchronous delivery to 3 students. The current course is designed at graduate/professional level with requirements that exceed undergraduate capabilities. 

**Critical Finding**: Assignments require **graduate-level implementation skills** while targeting **undergraduate learners**.

**Key Insight**: Your emphasis on forensics (Weeks 10-14) is excellent for undergraduates - these are the most engaging and career-relevant topics. However, early weeks (3, 6-8) require dramatic simplification to build toward forensics success.
