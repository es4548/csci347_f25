---

## üîß Major Simplifications Needed (Weeks 1-9)

### **Week 3: PKI Certificates** 
**Current**: Build complete Certificate Authority with CRL, OCSP, lifecycle management
**Undergraduate Version**: Certificate validation and trust chain analysis
```python
# Instead of building CA infrastructure:
# Focus on understanding and using certificates
def validate_certificate_chain(cert_file):
    """Learn how certificates work through analysis"""
    # Parse and validate existing certificates
    # Understand trust relationships
    # Check expiration and revocation
```

### **Week 6: Network Security**
**Current**: Deploy pfSense + GNS3 + Suricata + multi-zone network (20+ hours)
**Undergraduate Version**: Network security analysis and rule creation
```python
# Instead of network infrastructure:
# Focus on understanding network security through analysis
def analyze_firewall_logs(log_file):
    """Learn network security through log analysis"""
    # Parse firewall logs
    # Identify security events
    # Create basic detection rules
```

### **Week 7: SIEM and Monitoring**
**Current**: Build complete SIEM with ELK Stack, correlation rules, ML detection
**Undergraduate Version**: Security event analysis using existing SIEM tools
```python
# Instead of building SIEM:
# Use Splunk Free or pre-configured ELK to learn concepts
def analyze_security_events(events):
    """Learn SIEM concepts through analysis"""
    # Correlate related events
    # Create basic dashboards
    # Identify incident patterns
```

### **Week 8: Assessment Integration**
**Current**: Integrate weeks 3-7 into comprehensive penetration testing platform  
**Undergraduate Version**: Security assessment using standard tools
```python
# Instead of building assessment platform:
# Learn to use professional tools effectively
def security_assessment_report(target):
    """Learn assessment methodology"""
    # Use Nmap for scanning
    # Use OpenVAS for vulnerability detection
    # Generate professional reports
```
