## üÜò **Getting Help This Week**

**Technical Issues**:
1. Check `troubleshooting-pki.md` for certificate generation problems
2. Post in Canvas discussions with error messages and code snippets
3. Submit GitHub issue for assignment-specific CA system problems

**Conceptual Questions**:
1. Attend office hours (T/Th or by appointment) for PKI architecture questions
2. Email instructor for certificate validation clarifications
3. Form study groups to work through certificate chain problems

**Time Management**:
- PKI concepts can be complex - break tutorial into daily segments
- Use the 30-minute rule: get help if stuck on certificate errors
- Focus on understanding trust relationships over memorizing syntax

## üîí **Security Considerations This Week**

**Important Notes**:
- **Never use tutorial CAs in production** - these are for learning only
- **Protect private keys** - treat CA keys as highly sensitive
- **Understand trust implications** - adding CAs to trust stores has security impact
- **Certificate validation matters** - improper validation creates vulnerabilities

**Best Practices You'll Learn**:
- Proper certificate extensions for different use cases
- Secure serial number generation to prevent conflicts
- File permissions for protecting CA private keys
- Certificate revocation and CRL management

## üéâ **Week 3 Completion**

**Once Everything is Done**:
- [ ] Update your progress tracker
- [ ] Reflect: How does PKI enable trust in distributed systems?
- [ ] Preview Week 4 authentication systems materials
- [ ] Test your CA system with different certificate types
- [ ] Celebrate building enterprise-grade security infrastructure! üéâ

**Ready for Week 4?** You'll use your PKI knowledge to implement robust authentication systems with certificate-based authentication.

## üèÜ **Professional Development Bonus**

**Industry Connections**:
- Your CA system demonstrates skills directly applicable to:
  - DevOps/DevSecOps certificate automation
  - Cloud infrastructure security (AWS ACM, GCP Certificate Manager)
  - Enterprise security architecture roles
  - Cybersecurity engineering positions

**Portfolio Value**: This assignment shows employers you can implement production-level PKI systems, not just understand concepts.
