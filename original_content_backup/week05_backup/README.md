## Start Here (5 minutes)

1. **Complete readings** - [Required Reading](#required-reading) 
2. **Follow tutorial** - [Tutorial](tutorial.md)
3. **Complete assignment** - [Assignment](assignment.md) 
4. **Take quiz** - Quiz available in Canvas

## 🔗 **Integration with Previous Weeks**

This week builds directly on previous security foundations:
- **Week 3 PKI**: Certificate-based authentication for access control
- **Week 4 MFA**: Multi-factor authentication as prerequisite for access
- **Week 5 RBAC**: Role-based permissions building on authenticated identity
- **Integration Goal**: Complete identity → authentication → authorization chain

## 📚 **Step 1: Readings (90 minutes)**

**Access Control Fundamentals** *(Required)*:
- **NIST SP 800-162**: Attribute Based Access Control *(30 min)*
  - Focus: RBAC, ABAC, and policy-based access control
- **Access Control Models Overview** *(30 min)*
  - Focus: DAC, MAC, RBAC comparison and use cases
- **Principle of Least Privilege** *(30 min)*
  - Focus: Implementation strategies and security benefits

**📖 Reading Success Check**: Can you explain when to use DAC vs MAC vs RBAC, and how each integrates with authentication systems?

### Required Reading (4 hours)

1. **NIST RBAC Paper: "Role-Based Access Controls"**
   - **Link**: https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/conference-paper/1992/10/13/role-based-access-controls/final/documents/ferraiolo-kuhn-92.pdf

2. **Anderson's Security Engineering - Chapter 4**
   - **Link**: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html
   - **Focus**: Access Control principles and models

3. **Google BeyondCorp Papers** (Zero Trust Architecture)
   - **Link**: https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp#researchPapers

## 🛠️ **Step 2: Tutorial (4 hours)**

**What You'll Build**: Enterprise RBAC system integrated with Week 4 MFA authentication

**Comprehensive Learning Path**:
1. **RBAC Foundation** *(60 min)*: Role definition, hierarchy, and permission mapping
2. **DAC Implementation** *(60 min)*: User-controlled access permissions and sharing
3. **MAC Security Labels** *(60 min)*: Classification-based mandatory access control
4. **MFA Integration** *(60 min)*: Connecting access control with multi-factor authentication

**🎥 Tutorial Success Check**: Your system enforces role-based permissions after successful MFA authentication, demonstrates least privilege, and supports multiple access control models.

## 💻 **Step 3: Assignment (4 hours)**

**Deliverable**: Enterprise access control system with MFA integration

**Core Requirements**:
- RBAC system with hierarchical roles and permissions
- Integration with Week 4 MFA system for authentication
- Principle of least privilege enforcement
- Administrative interface for role management
- Audit logging for access attempts and changes
- Security policy documentation

**Integration Testing**: Must work seamlessly with your Week 4 MFA system, creating complete authentication → authorization flow.

**🏆 Grading**: 25 points based on access control effectiveness, MFA integration, security policy implementation, and documentation quality.

### Assignment: Zero Trust Access Control

Build an access control system featuring:
- RBAC with hierarchical roles and permissions
- Policy decision points (PDP) and enforcement points (PEP)
- JWT-based authorization with claims validation
- Audit logging and compliance reporting
- Risk-based access decisions

## 🏗️ **Project 2 Launch: Digital Forensics Platform**

**Project Overview**: Build comprehensive digital forensics platform for incident investigation and evidence analysis.

**Week 5 Project Activities**:
- **Project Planning** *(30 min)*: Architecture design and timeline planning
