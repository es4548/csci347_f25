## 📈 **Connection to Course Goals**

**This Week Contributes To**:
- **Learning Objective #3**: "Implement comprehensive security architectures" *(Direct integration of multiple security domains)*
- **Learning Objective #4**: "Evaluate and implement cryptographic protocols" *(PKI integration with network security)*
- **Learning Objective #5**: "Develop secure network applications" *(Identity-aware network infrastructure)*

**Builds On**:
- **Week 3**: PKI certificates now authenticate network devices and VPN users
- **Week 4**: MFA decisions now influence network access permissions
- **Week 5**: Access control policies now enforced at the network level

**Builds Toward**:
- **Week 7**: Security monitoring that correlates identity, access, and network events
- **Week 8**: Security assessments of integrated multi-domain architectures
- **Week 9**: Enterprise architectures with comprehensive security across all layers

**Career Relevance**: Integration skills are essential for security architects, network security engineers, and cybersecurity consultants designing enterprise security.

## 🔄 **Integration Strategy: Connecting Weeks 3-6**

### **Architectural Integration Flow**:
1. **Week 3 Foundation**: PKI certificates provide cryptographic identity foundation
2. **Week 4 Authentication**: MFA verifies user identity and establishes session
3. **Week 5 Authorization**: Role-based policies determine what access should be granted
4. **Week 6 Enforcement**: Network security enforces access decisions at infrastructure level

### **Success Strategy**:
1. **Review integration points** - Understand how each week's systems connect
2. **Test authentication flows** - Verify end-to-end user experience from MFA to network access
3. **Validate policy enforcement** - Confirm network controls match access control decisions
4. **Document architecture** - Explain how integrated systems provide comprehensive security

## 🆘 **Getting Help This Week**

**Integration Issues**:
1. Review integration examples in tutorial materials
2. Post in Canvas discussions with specific integration questions and architectural diagrams
3. Submit GitHub issues for complex multi-system integration problems

**Network Security Support**:
1. Check `troubleshooting-network.md` for firewall and VPN configuration issues
2. Use network scanning tools to validate segmentation effectiveness
3. Test authentication flows end-to-end to identify integration gaps

**Time Management**:
- **Use the integration mindset**: Don't build systems in isolation - always consider connections
- **Prioritize core integration**: Focus on making systems work together before adding advanced features
- **Test continuously**: Verify integration at each step rather than waiting until the end

## 🔒 **Security Focus This Week**

**Critical Integration Concepts**:
- **Identity-aware infrastructure**: Network security that knows who users are, not just what they're doing
- **Policy consistency**: Ensuring access decisions are enforced consistently across all security layers

- **Defense in depth**: Network security as one layer in comprehensive security architecture

**Advanced Security Techniques**:
- Dynamic firewall rules based on real-time authentication status
- Network segmentation that adapts to organizational role changes
- VPN access that provides different privileges based on user risk profile
- Behavioral anomaly detection that considers both identity and network contexts

**Enterprise Integration Requirements**:
- Seamless user experience across authentication and network access
- Centralized policy management spanning identity and network domains
