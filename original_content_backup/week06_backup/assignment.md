# Week 6 Assignment: Network Security Analysis & Policy Design

**Due**: End of Week 6 (see Canvas for exact deadline)  
**Points**: 25 points  
**Estimated Time**: 6 hours  
**Submission**: Submit Pull Request URL to Canvas

## üéØ Assignment Overview

Analyze network security configurations using provided firewall rules and network captures. This assignment focuses on security analysis and policy review using pre-configured tools and sample data.

## üìã Requirements

### Core Functionality (15 points)

**Focus Area: Firewall Analysis Engine**

#### 1. Firewall Rule Analysis (15 points)
Analyze provided firewall configurations:

- **Rule parser** for iptables format rules (provided samples)
- **Policy conflict detection** identifying overlapping or contradictory rules
- **Security gap identification** finding missing protections
- **Risk scoring** based on rule permissiveness
- **Report generation** with actionable recommendations

*Note: Network capture files and analysis tools provided as sample data*

### Documentation and Analysis (5 points)

Create focused security analysis documentation:

```
firewall_analysis_report.md    # Analysis of provided firewall rules
security_recommendations.md    # Policy improvement recommendations
```

### Security Analysis (5 points)

Provide professional security assessment:
- **Risk prioritization** of identified security gaps
- **Remediation timeline** with implementation difficulty
- **Cost-benefit analysis** of security improvements

## üß™ Testing and Validation

Your tools will be tested with:
- **Sample firewall configurations** (provided in resources/)
- **Network traffic captures** (pcap files provided)
- **Synthetic attack scenarios** for anomaly detection
- **Real-world policy frameworks** for compliance checking
