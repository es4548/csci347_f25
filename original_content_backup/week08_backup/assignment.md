## üèÜ Part I Network Security Capstone

This assignment represents the **capstone of Part I (Network Security)** by conducting a comprehensive security assessment using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

## üéØ Assignment Overview

Conduct a thorough security assessment using existing security tools and frameworks. Your implementation should demonstrate mastery of vulnerability assessment, risk analysis, and security reporting learned throughout Weeks 1-7.

**Key Focus**: Using professional tools effectively rather than building assessment platforms from scratch.

- **SIEM rule effectiveness** evaluation for detection coverage

**Deliverable**: `security_configuration_audit.md` with detailed findings and improvement recommendations

#### 3. Risk Assessment & Prioritization (20 points)
Create comprehensive risk analysis:

- **CVSS scoring** for identified vulnerabilities
- **Business impact assessment** considering asset criticality
- **Risk matrix development** plotting probability vs. impact
- **Remediation roadmap** with timeline and priority recommendations
- **Executive summary** suitable for management presentation

**Deliverable**: `risk_assessment_report.md` with executive summary and technical details

### Documentation & Analysis (20 points)

Create professional security assessment documentation:

```
executive_summary.md           # High-level findings for management
technical_findings.md          # Detailed technical analysis
remediation_plan.md           # Step-by-step improvement plan
assessment_methodology.md     # Tools and processes used
appendix/                     # Supporting evidence and screenshots
```

### Professional Presentation (10 points)

Develop a presentation suitable for:
- **Technical team briefing** (15 minutes)
- **Executive dashboard** (summary slides)
- **Remediation planning session** (actionable items)

## üß™ Testing Environment

Your assessment will use:
- **Intentionally vulnerable VMs** (provided)
- **Sample web applications** with known vulnerabilities
- **Test network configurations** with security gaps
- **Practice SSL certificates** with various issues
- **Realistic enterprise scenarios** for context

## üìä Assessment Tools (Provided)

You'll use these industry-standard tools:
- **Nmap** - Network discovery and port scanning
- **OpenVAS** - Comprehensive vulnerability scanner
- **OWASP ZAP** - Web application security testing
- **SSLyze** - SSL/TLS configuration analysis
