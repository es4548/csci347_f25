## 🔄 **Critical Transition: Part I → Part II**

**Part I Completion** *(Weeks 3-9)*: Preventive Security Mastery
✅ Cryptography and PKI foundations  
✅ Authentication and access control systems  
✅ Network security and monitoring  
✅ Security assessment and architecture design  

**Part II Preparation** *(Weeks 10-14)*: Reactive Security (Digital Forensics)
🔜 **Week 10**: Digital forensics foundations - investigating your architecture  
🔜 **Week 11**: Advanced forensics techniques  
🔜 **Week 12**: Memory analysis and malware investigation  
🔜 **Week 13**: Mobile forensics and advanced analysis  
🔜 **Week 14**: Integration and incident response  

## 🔜 **Part II Preview: Digital Forensics**

**Week 10: Digital Forensics Foundations** will begin your forensic investigation training:
- Investigating incidents in the architectures you've designed
- Using the evidence collection points you've established
- Applying chain of custody procedures from your forensic-ready designs
- Understanding how comprehensive architecture design enables effective forensics
