✅ **Week 4 MFA**: Multi-factor authentication systems  
✅ **Week 5 RBAC**: Role-based access control implementation  
✅ **Week 6 Network**: Network security and monitoring  
✅ **Week 7 SIEM**: Security monitoring and event correlation  
✅ **Week 8 Assessment**: Penetration testing and vulnerability analysis  
✅ **Week 9 Architecture**: Forensic-ready enterprise security design  

**Part II Launch** *(Weeks 10-14)*: Digital Forensics Investigation
🔜 **Week 10**: Digital forensics foundations - investigating your own architectures  
🔜 **Week 11**: Advanced forensics techniques and network analysis  
🔜 **Week 12**: Memory analysis and malware investigation  
🔜 **Week 13**: Mobile forensics and advanced artifact analysis

## 📚 **Step 1: Readings (90 minutes)**

**Core Digital Forensics Standards** *(Required)*:

### Primary References (60 minutes)
- **NIST SP 800-86**: Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response *(30 min)*
  - Focus: Sections 3-5 (Forensic Process, Evidence Collection, Analysis Techniques)
- **RFC 3227**: Guidelines for Evidence Collection and Archiving *(30 min)*
  - Focus: Legal requirements, chain of custody, evidence preservation

### Legal Frameworks (30 minutes)
- **ISO/IEC 27037**: Digital Evidence Collection Guidelines *(15 min)*
  - Focus: International standards for evidence handling
- **Federal Rules of Evidence**: Article VII (Opinions and Expert Testimony) *(15 min)*
  - Focus: Expert testimony requirements and court admissibility

**Focus**: Understanding how digital forensics methodology provides the investigative complement to the preventive security measures built in Weeks 3-9.

**📖 Reading Success Check**: Can you explain how the forensic-ready architecture from Week 9 supports the investigative techniques you'll learn in Part II?
