## üìà Assessment Criteria

Projects are graded using a 5-point scale (Excellent=5, Proficient=4, Developing=3, Needs Improvement=2, Inadequate=1, No Submission=0) across three main areas:

### Grading Breakdown
- **Technical Implementation** (40%): Does it work correctly and securely?
- **Code Quality** (30%): Is it well-written, documented, and tested? 
- **Professional Presentation** (30%): Is it clearly documented and demonstrated?

### What Excellence Looks Like
- **Technical**: System works perfectly, handles edge cases, follows security best practices
- **Code Quality**: Clean, well-documented code with comprehensive testing
- **Presentation**: Professional documentation and effective demonstration of capabilities

### Grade Scale
- **90-100%**: Exceptional work, ready for industry use
- **80-89%**: Good work, minor improvements needed  
- **70-79%**: Adequate work, meets basic requirements
- **60-69%**: Below expectations, significant issues
- **Below 60%**: Unsatisfactory, major problems
