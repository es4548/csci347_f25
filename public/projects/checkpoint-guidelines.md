# 📍 Project Checkpoint Guidelines

**Course**: CSCI 347 - Network Security and Digital Forensics  
**Purpose**: Structured checkpoints for major projects to ensure timely completion

---

## 🎯 Why Checkpoints Matter

- **Prevent last-minute panic** - Distribute work across available time
- **Early feedback opportunity** - Catch issues before final submission
- **Reduce cognitive load** - Break complex projects into manageable pieces
- **Build confidence** - Regular progress validation
- **Improve quality** - Time for iteration and refinement

## 📊 Checkpoint Schedule Overview

Each major project has **3 mandatory checkpoints**:

| Checkpoint | Timing | Weight | Purpose |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|
| **CP1: Design** | 25% through | 10% | Architecture & planning |
| **CP2: Core Implementation** | 50% through | 15% | Basic functionality |
| **CP3: Integration** | 75% through | 15% | Feature complete |
| **Final Submission** | 100% | 60% | Polished & documented |

## 💡 Success Tips

### Time Management
```python
# Suggested time allocation per checkpoint
def allocate_project_time(total_hours=20):
    return {
        'checkpoint_1': total_hours * 0.20,  # 4 hours
        'checkpoint_2': total_hours * 0.30,  # 6 hours  
        'checkpoint_3': total_hours * 0.30,  # 6 hours
        'final_polish': total_hours * 0.20   # 4 hours
    }
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Starting late** - Begin immediately after project assigned
2. **Skipping design** - Invest time in planning
3. **No testing** - Test continuously, not just at end
4. **Poor commits** - Make meaningful, frequent commits
5. **Documentation last** - Document as you build

### Getting Help
- **Office Hours**: Priority support for checkpoint issues
- **Peer Reviews**: Exchange feedback with classmates
- **Discussion Forum**: Share non-code solutions
- **TA Sessions**: Technical implementation help

---

## 🔄 Revision Policy
