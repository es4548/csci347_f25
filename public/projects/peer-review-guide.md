    Final Submission (Day 7)
```

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Prepare for Review (Author)
**When**: After initial implementation (Day 3-4)  
**Time Required**: 30 minutes

```markdown
## Peer Review Request Template

### Project/Assignment
- **Name**: Week 6 Network Security Scanner
- **Current Status**: Core functionality complete (80%)
- **Review Branch**: feature/network-scanner

### Specific Review Requests
1. Security of the port scanning implementation
2. Error handling completeness
3. Code organization and readability
4. Performance optimization suggestions

### Known Issues
- Rate limiting not yet implemented
- Documentation incomplete for API module

### Time Estimate for Review
- Approximately 30-45 minutes

### Files to Focus On
- `src/scanner.py` - Main scanning logic
- `src/security_checks.py` - Vulnerability detection
- `tests/test_scanner.py` - Test coverage
```

#### Step 2: Conduct Review (Reviewer)
**When**: Within 24 hours of request  
**Time Required**: 30-45 minutes

**Review Checklist**:
- [ ] Code runs without errors
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities checked
- [ ] Logic and algorithms verified
- [ ] Code style and readability assessed
- [ ] Test coverage reviewed
- [ ] Documentation completeness checked
- [ ] Performance considerations noted

#### Step 3: Provide Feedback (Reviewer)
**When**: By end of Day 5  
**Format**: Structured feedback form

```markdown
## Peer Review Feedback

### Reviewer Information
- **Reviewer**: [Your Name]
- **Date**: [Date]
- **Time Spent**: 45 minutes

### Overall Assessment
**Grade**: B+ (85/100)
**Summary**: Solid implementation with good security practices. A few areas need attention before final submission.

### Strengths ‚úÖ
1. **Excellent error handling** in network connection module
2. **Clean code structure** - easy to follow logic
3. **Good security practices** - input validation present
4. **Comprehensive testing** - 85% code coverage

### Areas for Improvement ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Rate limiting missing** - Could DoS target systems
2. **Hardcoded credentials** in config.py (lines 15-17)
3. **No timeout handling** for hung connections
4. **Documentation sparse** for security_checks module

### Critical Issues üî¥
1. **SQL Injection Risk** - Line 142 in database.py
   ```python
   # Current (vulnerable)
   query = f"SELECT * FROM hosts WHERE ip = '{ip_address}'"
   
   # Suggested fix
   query = "SELECT * FROM hosts WHERE ip = ?"
   cursor.execute(query, (ip_address,))
   ```

2. **Unencrypted Password Storage** - auth.py line 78
   ```python
   # Current (insecure)
   password_hash = hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()
   
   # Suggested fix
   from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash
   password_hash = generate_password_hash(password)
   ```

### Code Quality Suggestions üí°
1. **Add type hints** for better code clarity:
   ```python
   def scan_port(host: str, port: int, timeout: float = 1.0) -> bool:
   ```

2. **Extract magic numbers** to constants:
   ```python
   # Instead of
   if retry_count > 3:
   
   # Use
   MAX_RETRIES = 3
   if retry_count > MAX_RETRIES:
   ```

3. **Improve variable naming**:
   ```python
   # Instead of
   res = scan(h, p)
   
   # Use
   scan_result = scan_port(host, port)
   ```

### Performance Optimization üöÄ
1. **Use threading pool** for parallel scanning:
   ```python
   from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
   
   with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
       results = executor.map(scan_port, port_list)
   ```

2. **Cache DNS lookups** to reduce redundant queries

### Testing Recommendations üß™
1. Add edge case tests for malformed inputs
2. Include performance benchmarks
3. Add integration tests for full workflow

### Security Recommendations üîê
1. Implement rate limiting (suggested: 10 requests/second)
2. Add authentication for sensitive operations
3. Log all scanning activities for audit trail
4. Validate all inputs against whitelist

### Documentation Suggestions üìù
1. Add docstrings to all public methods
2. Include usage examples in README
3. Document security considerations
4. Add API reference for module

### Final Recommendations
**Must Fix Before Submission**:
- SQL injection vulnerability
- Password storage issue
- Add rate limiting

**Should Fix**:
- Timeout handling
- Documentation
- Remove hardcoded credentials

**Nice to Have**:
- Performance optimizations
- Additional tests
- Type hints

### Questions for Author
1. Is the rate limiting intentionally left for later?
2. What's the expected load for this scanner?
3. Should we support IPv6 addresses?

**Great work overall! Fix the critical issues and this will be an excellent submission.**
```

#### Step 4: Respond to Feedback (Author)
**When**: Day 5-6  
**Required**: Feedback acknowledgment

```markdown
## Response to Peer Review

### Thank You
Thank you for the thorough review! Your feedback is extremely helpful.

### Actions Taken
‚úÖ **Fixed SQL injection vulnerability** - Now using parameterized queries
‚úÖ **Updated password storage** - Implemented bcrypt hashing
‚úÖ **Added rate limiting** - 10 req/sec limit implemented
‚úÖ **Fixed timeout handling** - All network calls now have timeouts
‚úÖ **Removed hardcoded credentials** - Moved to environment variables

### Partial Implementation
‚ö†Ô∏è **Documentation** - Added docstrings to critical methods (70% complete)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Type hints** - Added to main module (will complete rest post-submission)

### Not Implemented (with reasoning)
‚ùå **IPv6 support** - Out of scope for this assignment
‚ùå **Performance optimization** - Current speed acceptable for requirements

### Follow-up Questions
1. Could you elaborate on the caching strategy for DNS?
2. Which threading approach would you recommend for this use case?

### Lessons Learned
- Always use parameterized queries
- MD5 should never be used for passwords
- Rate limiting is critical for scanners

Thanks again for your time and expertise!

## üîÑ Peer Review Pairing

### Automatic Pairing System
```python
def create_review_pairs(students, avoid_repeats=True):
    """
    Create peer review pairs ensuring:
    1. Everyone reviews and gets reviewed
    2. No self-review
    3. Minimize repeat pairings
    """
    import random
    
    review_pairs = []
    students_copy = students.copy()
    random.shuffle(students_copy)
    
    for i in range(len(students_copy)):
        reviewer = students_copy[i]
        author = students_copy[(i + 1) % len(students_copy)]
        review_pairs.append((reviewer, author))
    
    return review_pairs

# Example output:
# [(Alice, Bob), (Bob, Charlie), (Charlie, Alice)]
```

### Manual Pairing (for special cases)
- **Skill matching**: Pair similar skill levels
- **Learning goals**: Pair for specific learning objectives
- **Time zones**: Consider availability for synchronous review

## üõ†Ô∏è Peer Review Tools

### GitHub Pull Request Reviews
```markdown
## Setup for PR Review
1. Fork classmate's repository
2. Create branch for review comments
3. Make inline comments on code
4. Submit review with summary
```

### Code Review Comment Examples
```python
# üî¥ Critical Issue
# SECURITY: SQL injection vulnerability here
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"  # Never use f-strings for SQL!

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Suggestion
# PERFORMANCE: This loop is O(n¬≤), consider using a set for O(n)
for item in list1:
    if item in list2:  # This does linear search each time
        matches.append(item)

# üí° Nice to Have
# STYLE: Consider using more descriptive variable name
for i in data:  # What does 'i' represent?
    process(i)

# ‚úÖ Positive Feedback
# GOOD: Excellent error handling here!
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except SpecificException as e:
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}")
    return safe_default
```
