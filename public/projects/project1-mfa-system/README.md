- SMS/Email verification codes with expiration
- QR code generation for authenticator app setup
- Backup codes generation and validation

**Something You Are (Inherence Factor)**
- FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware security key support
- Biometric authentication simulation (fingerprint/face ID mock)
- Certificate-based authentication integration

### 2. Security Features

**Risk-Based Authentication**

- Adaptive authentication based on risk scores

**Session Management**
- Secure JWT token generation and validation
- Session timeout and refresh mechanisms
- Multi-device session tracking
- Secure logout and session invalidation

**Ready to build enterprise-grade security?** Start with the core password authentication and build up to the advanced MFA features. Focus on security from the beginning - it's much harder to add security later than to build it in from the start.

Good luck! 🔐
