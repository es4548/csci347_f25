## üí° **Week 2 Key Insights**

**Security Principles**:
- **Hash functions are one-way**: Easy to compute forward, impossible to reverse
- **Collisions are theoretically possible**: But computationally infeasible with proper algorithms
- **Salt prevents rainbow tables**: Always use unique salt for password hashing
- **HMAC provides authenticity**: Proves message came from someone with the secret key
- **Digital signatures provide non-repudiation**: Only private key holder could create signature

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Using MD5 or SHA-1 for security purposes (both cryptographically broken)
- Storing passwords without salt (vulnerable to rainbow table attacks)
- Using simple hash instead of HMAC for authentication
- Not verifying digital signatures properly
- Assuming hash functions provide encryption (they don't!)

## üìä Key Concepts Summary

| Concept | Week 1 (Encryption) | Week 2 (Hashing/Signatures) |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Confidentiality | Integrity & Authentication |
| **Reversible** | Yes (with key) | No (one-way function) |
| **Key Type** | Symmetric | None (hash) or Asymmetric (signatures) |
| **Output Size** | Variable | Fixed |
| **Performance** | Fast | Very fast (hash), Slow (signatures) |

## üöÄ Next Week Preview
