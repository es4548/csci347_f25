1. **Implement** password-based authentication with secure hashing
2. **Integrate** TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords) using existing libraries  
3. **Create** backup code systems for account recovery
4. **Analyze** MFA security properties and attack vectors
5. **Evaluate** different authentication factors and their trade-offs
6. **Apply** MFA concepts in real-world security scenarios

## Start Here (5 minutes)

1. **Complete readings** - [Required Reading](#-step-1-readings-45-minutes)
2. **Follow tutorial** - [Tutorial](tutorial.md) (2.5 hours)
3. **Complete assignment** - [Assignment](assignment.md) (1.5 hours)
4. **Take quiz** - Quiz available in Canvas

## 📚 **Step 1: Readings (45 minutes)**

**Core Reading** *(Required)*:
- **NIST Digital Identity Guidelines** - SP 800-63B sections 1-3 *(25 min)*
  - Focus: Authentication factors and security requirements
  - Why: Industry standard for authentication security

**Technical Implementation**:
- **TOTP Algorithm** - RFC 6238 overview *(10 min)*
  - Focus: How time-based tokens work
  - Why: Technical foundation for 2FA implementation

**Security Analysis**:
- **Common MFA Attacks** - Research summary *(10 min)*
  - Focus: SIM swapping, phishing, token theft
  - Why: Understanding what MFA protects against

**📖 Reading Success Check**: Can you explain why SMS-based 2FA is less secure than TOTP?

## 🛠️ **Step 2: Tutorial (2.5 hours)**

**What You'll Learn**: How to implement multi-factor authentication using existing libraries

**Learning Path**:
1. **Module 1** *(60 min)*: Password authentication with bcrypt
2. **Module 2** *(60 min)*: TOTP implementation with pyotp library
3. **Module 3** *(30 min)*: Backup codes and recovery mechanisms

**🎥 Tutorial Success Check**: Your MFA system works with Google Authenticator

**Key Skills Developed**:
- Secure password hashing and verification
- TOTP token generation and validation
- QR code generation for authenticator setup
- Backup code management

## 💻 **Step 3: Assignment (1.5 hours)**

**What You'll Build**: Multi-factor authentication system using existing libraries

**Core Requirements**:
- Password authentication with proper hashing
- TOTP integration with authenticator apps
- Backup code generation and validation
- Security analysis of your implementation

**Skills Applied**:
- Using authentication libraries effectively
- Understanding authentication security trade-offs
- Implementing proper error handling
- Professional security documentation

## ✅ **Step 4: Quiz**

**Location**: Quiz available in Canvas  
**Time**: 15 minutes  
**Focus**: MFA concepts, authentication factors, security analysis

The quiz tests your understanding of authentication factors, TOTP algorithms, and MFA security properties.
