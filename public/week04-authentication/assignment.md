## ðŸŽ¯ Assignment Overview

Analyze and implement a simplified MFA system using existing authentication libraries. Focus on understanding different authentication factors and their security properties.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

### Core Implementation (15 points)

#### 1. Password Authentication (5 points)
- Use bcrypt for secure password hashing
- Implement proper salt generation
- Add password strength checking
- Handle authentication attempts securely

#### 2. TOTP Implementation (5 points)
- Use pyotp library for TOTP generation
- Generate QR codes for easy setup
- Implement time-window tolerance
- Test with Google Authenticator

#### 3. Backup Codes (5 points)
- Generate secure random backup codes
- Implement one-time use mechanism
- Store hashed versions only
- Provide recovery workflow

### Security Analysis (5 points)

Write a security analysis covering:
- Comparison of authentication factors (something you know/have/are)
- Attack vectors for each factor
- Best practices for MFA implementation
- Analysis of real-world MFA failures

### Testing and Documentation (5 points)

- Test suite for all auth methods
- Clear usage documentation
- Security considerations document

## ðŸ”§ Starter Code Provided

We provide a template with authentication framework - you just need to implement the core logic.

## Submission

- `mfa_system.py` - Your implementation
