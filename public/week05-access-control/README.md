## 🎯 **Learning Objectives (What You'll Master)**

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
1. **Implement** role-based access control (RBAC) systems
2. **Design** role hierarchies and permission mappings
3. **Create** access control enforcement mechanisms
4. **Analyze** access control security properties and vulnerabilities
5. **Compare** different access control models (RBAC, MAC, DAC)
6. **Apply** RBAC principles in practical security scenarios

## Start Here (5 minutes)

1. **Complete readings** - [Required Reading](#-step-1-readings-45-minutes)
2. **Follow tutorial** - [Tutorial](tutorial.md) (2.5 hours)  
3. **Complete assignment** - [Assignment](assignment.md) (1.5 hours)
4. **Take quiz** - Quiz available in Canvas

## 📚 **Step 1: Readings (45 minutes)**

**Core Reading** *(Required)*:
- **NIST RBAC Model** - Role Based Access Control overview *(20 min)*
  - Focus: RBAC components and principles
  - Why: Industry standard access control model

**Comparative Analysis**:
- **Access Control Models** - RBAC vs MAC vs DAC *(15 min)*
  - Focus: When to use each model
  - Why: Understanding access control trade-offs

**Implementation Guidance**:
- **RBAC Best Practices** - Security patterns *(10 min)*
  - Focus: Common RBAC implementation issues
  - Why: Avoiding security pitfalls

**📖 Reading Success Check**: Can you explain when RBAC is more appropriate than DAC?

## 🛠️ **Step 2: Tutorial (2.5 hours)**

**What You'll Learn**: How to implement role-based access control systems

**Learning Path**:
1. **Module 1** *(60 min)*: RBAC fundamentals and role design
2. **Module 2** *(60 min)*: Permission enforcement and checking
3. **Module 3** *(30 min)*: Audit logging and access monitoring

**🎥 Tutorial Success Check**: Your RBAC system correctly enforces role-based permissions

**Key Skills Developed**:
- Designing role hierarchies and permission structures
- Implementing access control decorators and middleware
- Creating audit logs for access attempts
- Testing access control enforcement

## 💻 **Step 3: Assignment (1.5 hours)**

**What You'll Build**: Role-based access control system with file system demo

**Core Requirements**:
- RBAC implementation with roles and permissions
- File system access control demonstration
- Audit logging for all access attempts
- Security analysis of your design

**Skills Applied**:
- Access control system design and implementation
- Security enforcement and validation
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Professional security documentation

## ✅ **Step 4: Quiz**

**Location**: Quiz available in Canvas  
**Time**: 15 minutes  
**Focus**: RBAC concepts, access control models, security analysis

The quiz tests your understanding of access control principles, RBAC implementation, and security trade-offs.
