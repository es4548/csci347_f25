**Required Features:**
- **File system parsing** (simulate NTFS/ext4 structures)
- **Directory tree reconstruction** with deleted entries
- **File metadata extraction** (timestamps, permissions, size)
- **Slack space analysis** for hidden data
- **Master file table** simulation and analysis

**Deliverable:** `filesystem_analyzer.py` with parsing and analysis functions

### 3. Timeline & Artifact Recovery (5 points)

Build timeline reconstruction and artifact recovery:

**Required Features:**
- **Timeline generation** from file system timestamps
- **Deleted file recovery** using file signatures
- **File carving** for fragmented files
- **Registry artifact** simulation (Windows-style)
- **Browser history** reconstruction from databases

**Deliverable:** `timeline_builder.py` and `artifact_extractor.py`

### 4. Forensic Reporting (5 points)

Generate professional forensic investigation reports:

**Required Features:**
- **Executive summary** with key findings
- **Technical analysis** with detailed evidence
- **Timeline reports** in multiple formats
- **Evidence catalog** with hash verification
- **Chain of custody** documentation

**Deliverable:** `forensic_reporter.py` with multiple report formats

### 5. Chain of Custody Management (5 points)

Implement complete chain of custody tracking:

**Required Features:**
- **Evidence tracking** from acquisition to analysis
- **Operator logging** with authentication
- **Action auditing** with timestamps
- **Transfer documentation** between analysts
- **Integrity verification** at each step

**Deliverable:** Chain of custody system integrated across all modules
